What I did in this latest update (5/5):
Merged the toolbars - black toolbar doesn't hide
Added a color picker
Brush Size is changed with a slider
Fixed the Refresh issue
Increased code organization by splitting into multiple files

(5/6):
If you change brush options and goto next page it stays the same unlike before
If you open color picker but don't pick a color then dropdown disappears unlike before
