README

What I did in this latest update:
Merged the toolbars - black toolbar doesn't hide
Added a color picker
Brush Size is changed with a slider
Fixed the Refresh issue
Increased code organization by splitting into multiple files


Notable things to fix before deployment:
If you open the color picker but dont pick a color the dropdown shows
If you change brush options and then go to the next page the brush goes back to the default settings
